Name: Erik van Tilborg
Assignment: PS1b

the purpose of this assignment was to use
the flfsr that we coded for the previous
assignment and use it to encode and decode
images based on a 16 bit entry for the flfsr.

the project files all work correctly and 
display the results in 2 sfml windows.
the first window shows the input image as
it stands before encryption, and the second
window shows the encrypted image. 

when the program runs the second time with
the output of the first time being passed
as the input and the output being saved as
another image, along with the same 16 bit 
flfsr string, the encrypted image (output of
the first time) will be decrypted and result
in the original image with no loss in data.
